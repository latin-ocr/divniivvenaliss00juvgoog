liv m'rnonucrrou

aside from futuras and other future participles in combina-
tion with esse, instances are rare before Livy.¹

119. Gerundive. The gerundive is sometimes used as a
future passive participle: ay. 14, 268 habitas coro semper
tollendus et austro ,· 14, 314 passuras gestis aequanda peri-
cula rebus. In still later times this tendency was more
consistently carried out, ay. ayendam esse = actam iri
in Ammianus, SymmachUS, and other late writers.'

120. Pei-fect. , Α perfect participle is used with habere to
. denote the continuance of a condition: 13, 193 f. quos diri
conscia faeti mens habet attonitos ; similarly an adjective: 10,
296 f. miseros trepidosque parentes semper habet. Sollicitam
habere is far more common than either of J uvenal’s expres-
sions.¹

For the perfect participle with quamquam and quamviS,
see §g 113, b and 114, b.

order of words

121. An appositive is placed between a substantive and
its qualifying adjective in 3, 48 exeo tamquam ‘mancas et ex-
tinctae, corpas non utile, dextrae. A similar arrangement
may be seen in Catull. 64, 184 nullo litae, sola insula, tecta.

122. The subject is very frequently the last word in its
clause: aq. 1, 613 3, 151 3 6 A, 22, 343 7, '73 15, 161.

123. The antecedent is sometimes found in the relative
clause at or near the end: aq. 1, 116 quaeque salutato cre-
pitat Concordia nido ,⁰ 3, 2571. qui saxa Liquetica portat
axz-3.

124. An adjective which modifies two substantives is
usually placed between them, sometimes before the conjunc-
tion, sometimes after: ay. 11, 39 f. aere paterno ac rebus ,·
