SATIRE III

THE POOR. IN THEGREAT CITY

It is generally admitted that this is the best os J uvenal's satireS. The
faulty structure, the absurd exaggeration, and the empty rhetoric which
disfigure some of his work are not obtrusive here, and his descriptive
powers are seen at their best.¹ After giving his piece a dramatio setting
by introducing Umbricius as the speaker, Juvenal paints in distinct out-
line and vivid color scene after scene from Roman life. Nowhere in
literature, perhaps, have we more clear and lifelike pictures os the past,
—whioh, once enjoyed, become'a prioeless and abiding possession.

Among modern imitations the most noteworthy is Samuel Johnson's
‘ Londou, a Poem in Imitation of the Third Satire of J uvenal‚’ published
in 1738. The translation os Dryden is found in vol. xm, pp. 135 ff.

1-20. 1 am quite upset by the departure of my old friend UmbriciuS,
but Ι think he is wise in seeking a safer and more congenial home.
While his effeots were being paoked into the wagon‚ he walked with me
into Egeria’s vale, now the haunt of beggam.
