education of the 60116616.ι That his rhetorical studies were
long-continued is stated by the vitae, and could easily be
inferred from the satires themselves, which abound in sen-
tentiae and stock illustratione, and, especially in the later
bookS, are more like moral essays or declamatione than real
satires.' Among his teachers may have been Quintilian,'
whom he several times 'mentions with greatest reverence.
During this earlier part of his life he may have heard the
recitations of the poet Statius, to whom he gives the warm-
est praise,⁴ and he was certainly on terms of intimacy with
Martial.⁸ Moreover, like Martial, he 1166, for a time at least,

which, 66 6 11116, attack the society ot the poet's time, and the later poems, which discuss
absh-act subjecte, such as revenge, avarlce, and parental influence, led Ο. Ribbeck to pro-
pound his extravagant theory that the tenth and the last ssve satires were not the work ol'
Juvenal, but of some unknown rhetorician (Der echte und der unechte Juvenal, Berlin,

of conum-displays in doctoral dissertatione, should never have been taken seriously.
