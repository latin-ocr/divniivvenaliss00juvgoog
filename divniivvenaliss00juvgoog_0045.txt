INTRonuc'rIoN xxxix

weakening of its original force may be detected in Vergil, and
in prose from Valerius Maximus. In Juvenal the older
meaning cannot be clearly discerned in half of the occur-
rences, and in several instances it is certainly absent: ay.
4, 66 f. yeuialis ayatur iste dies ,· 6, 295 f. liiuefluxit ad istos
et Sybaris collis (the hills of Rome, in 9, 131 liis collibus) 3
cf. 1, 1393 3, 187 3 3, 29 istic (in Rome), and Ital. stanotte,
‘ to-night ' (= ista ποοίθ).ι

62. Interrogative. a. Quis for qui. Juvenal always uses
quis for qui in questions both direct and indirect: ey. 6,
571 quis mensis ,· 7, 63 quis loeus ; 14, 178 -quis metus ,⁰ 15,
119 quis casus, This is true also of Horace and Persius.'

b. Qui for quis. In one instance, doubtless for the sake
of euphony, qui is used for quis: 11, 33 te consule qui sis ,·
cf. Plaut. (ἔαρι. 560 neque seit qui siet ,· id. Uist. 164 nescit
qui siet.

e. Quis for uter. In two instances quis is loosely'used
where only two alternatives are suggested ε 8, 196 quid satius 2>
10, 338 quid placeat dic. This is not common, but it occurs
in Cicero (9.9. Att. XVI, 14, 1), in Vergil (e. 9. Aen. XII, 727),
and in other authors. Of. ξ 6-4 a.⁸

d. Two interrogative pronouns are occasionally found in
one question: (3.9. 5, 80 f. aspice.. ‚quibus undique saepta
asparayis qua despiciat convivia cauda ; 10, 69 f. quisnam
delator quibus iudicibus? 12, 48 qua muudi parte quis audet.⁴

63. Relative. Quicumque is often used as an indefinite

’ pronoun (= quilibet), especially in prepositional phrases:

ey. 6, 412 quocumque in trivio. . ‚narrat ,- 3, 156, 230 3 6 A,
13 8, 2²7 3 14, 42, etc. This is very rare in CicerO, but be-
comes common in the Silver Age: cf. ἓ 66.⁶

64. Indefinite. a. Quisque for uterque. As quis for uter
