together with the Bodleian additions mentioned in the fol-
lowing section, may be supposed to have come from an
' earlier archetype.¹ ’
33. Codex Bodleianus. One os the MSS. of the inferior
class deserves more extended notice, because of certain fea-
> tures which make it unique among the sources of the text of
Juvenal z I refer to the Bodleian Ms. (Canonicianus xm) of
the eleventh century, brought to light by E. Ο. Winstedt, who
published the first collation in May, 1899? This codex,
though decidedly one of the ‹su-class, oftener, perhaps, than any
other of its fellows is in agreement with P, and at the same
time offers some readings which are quite new and well worth
consideration.⁸ Its most important features, however, are

-that it is written in a Lombardic hand, though Ppr are ²
in Caroline minusculas, and that it makes two additions to
the traditional text of Juvenal, one of two verses, the other
of thirty-four verseS, both in the body of the sixth satire.⁴
If the verses are Juvenal’s—and no one but Buecheler has
expressed a doubt of their genuineness—it seems probable
that the parent of the BodleianuS, which itself came from a
common archetype with ω, received the additions from some
MS. not only earlier than P, but earlier than the recension of
Nicaeus.‘

¹ Buecheler (l. 1.), however, believes that all the extant Mss. are derlved from the
Nicaean recension, and tries to account tor the fact that P has not preserved the sub·
scription ot Nicaeus.

,from any other ΜΒ. ς Max Mans (A.L.L. ιι, 1899, p. 420) examined sixteen in Munich,
and lt. Ο. Winstedt more recently asty-nine in the British Museum for this purpose
(Class. Rev„ xvr, 1902, pp. 40-6). ,
⁸ P. v. Winterfeld, in Εὕα. gel. Anz„ 1899, p. 896, has shown how this may have taken
place. 'rho scribe of the archetype ot the Bodleianus placed the shorter addition of two
verses on the margin ς but, not having room for the longer passage, inserted a leat to con-
tain it, making the necessary indications to show its place in the text (atter v. ³45). But
the copyist oi the Bodleiamoe, not observing the sign, nnished the page (to v. ὃῦω and
then added the thirty-rom· verses from the inserted leaf. This would account for the
position oi the verses in the ΜΒ.
