SATIRE 1 3

5. Telephus, king of Mysia, was wounded by the lance of Achilles and -
enred by the rust of the same weapon.¹ This story, as well as that of
OresteS, was a favorite subject for tragedy and was used by all the great
Greek tragic poets, At Rome Ennius and Accius wrote tragedies with
this title.² summi: this Orestes is so long that on the last sheet it fills
the margin to the very top and, though it runs over on the back, is still
unfinished. The sheets of papyrus oi which the roll consisted were glued
together at the sideS‚ where a considerable margin was lert for this pur-
pose.⁸ margine: elsewhere often masculine.⁴ Orestes ε see notes
on 8, 215 ff. and 14, 284. On the rhythm, see §14¹2 d.

6. necdum: for nondum, though really equal to et nondum (ξ 79).

7. During the time of Juvenal the most diligently cultivated class of
poetry was the epic, satirized in the next five verseS. This preference
was due in large measure to the influence os Vergil and to the training
os the sch0018.⁶ nota . . ‚domusz proverbial like our “as well as 1
know my own name '' (ἓ 143) ; Cic. Quint. Frat. 1, 1, 45 eum iam tibi
Asia sie, uti uni cuique sua domus, nota esse debeat.⁸ magis:
nota ma9i3=notior, which occurs in 9, 25. See ¹557, a. lucus
Martis: probably the one in Colchis of PontuS, in which the golden fleece
hung guarded by a dragon (hence 14, 114 serpens Ponticus) 3 cf. Val.
Fl. V, 228 f. vellera Martis in umbra. . ‚Phrixus liquerat. On the
rhythm, see g 147„ d.

8. Aeoliis . . ‚Vulcaniz northeast os Sicily lie seven volcanic islandS,
known in antiquity as insulae Aeoliae, from Aeolus the keeper of the
windS, οι· insulae Liparaeae, from Lipara, the largest of the group.'' The

sorge of Vulcan was localized in fhe most southerly of these islands,
Hiera (Ἱερὰ Ἡφαίστου, still known as Vulcano), which Juvenal refers to
again in 13, 45 as Liparaea taberna and Vergil calls Volcani domus et
Volcania nomine tellus (Aenss v111, 422).

9. venti: represented in most epic poema e.g. Verg. Aen. 1, 50-156 3

refers especially to the Arqonauuea of Valerius Flaccus is possible but scarcely probatae,
