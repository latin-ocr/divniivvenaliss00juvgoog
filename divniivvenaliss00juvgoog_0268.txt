38. parva nablia-h: see §131 and note on 1, 71.

33. vniat: the copulative use of venire is by no means rare in Latin,
especially in poetry which shows a marked colloquial element, e.g. Ovid,
Med. Pom. 48 veniet myis altera causa dolor,· id. Am. 1, 10, 33 ;
Mart. 1, 52, δ adsertor venias. In such cases, though venire is essentially
a copula, the force of the verb of motion is more or less distinctly felt.¹
Cf. the auxiliary use ot venire in Italian, and such English expressions
as ⁴ run wild,' ⁸ go crazy‚’ ‘ fall ill.’ hederis: a wreath of ivy, which
was sacred to Bacchus, is the poet's reward ; cf. Hor. 0. 1, 1, 29
dodanam hederae praemia frontium. Sometimes it was placed on the
bust or statue of a poet 3 cf. ovid, Trist. 1, 7, 1 f.; PerS. prol. 5 f.

30-73. Your patron writes verses himself to avoid the necessity of buy·
ing yours‚ and at most lends you a vacant house tor recitation and a few ·
ot his clients to applaud‚ leaving you to defray the incidental expenseS.
The true poet, however, needs a serene spirit in close communion with
nature. Horace and Vergil could not have written as they did, is they
had been worried with baser cares,

36. aooipe: on the form of transition, see g 140, a.

37. lunarum et Apollinis aede: the poet has renounced his allegiance
to the Muses and Apollo in order to attend upon his patron. This does
not necessarily refer to the magnificent temple ot Apollo on the Pala-
tine, with its Greek and Latin librarieS, dedicated by Octavian in
28 Β.ο. ·

39. millo: this looks like a round number, but is not far from dates
usually assigned ; e.g. Herodotus (11, 53) placed him about 840 Rc, and
Vell. Patere. 1, 5, writing about 30 An, said (Homerus) ferme ante
annos Dccccn floruit, intra mille natus est.
