the first saturae of which we have any knowledge, those of
Q. Ennius (239-169 B.o.), are simply a collection of poems,
in various metres, treating of various subjects. The same

· literary form was adopted by M. Terentius Varro of Reate

(116428 Bc), in his Saturae Menippeae, which, though mod-
elled to some extent after Menippus, yet in their general char·
acter differ little from the saturae of Ennius.

4. Lucilius and his successorS. To G. Lucilius (180-
103 Β.ο.), on theother hand, is ascribed the-introduction of
the element of personal criticism and invective, an clement
which is characteristic in varying degrees of the satiric
writing of Horace, PetroniuS, Seneca, Persius„ and Juvenal,
and is an essential feature of satire in modern literature.
At the same time, the conception of the satura as a medley
seems never to have faded out of the Roman mind3 for every-
where a wide range of subjects is admitted, and in Lucilius,
Varr0, and Petronius various metres are employed, though
Persius and Juvenal, following the example of Horace,
excluded all but the dactylic hexameter. The variety of
subject, the personal element, the dramatic situation and
occasional dialogue, the criticism of men and manners, and
the colloquial style—the leading characteristics os the de·
partment—are all prominent in Juvenal, who must now be·
considered in more detail.¹‘
