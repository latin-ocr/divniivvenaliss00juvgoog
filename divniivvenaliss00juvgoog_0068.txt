was developed and observed with especial care by the Roman
poets, as their verse was recited, not sung.

a. ansura semiquinaria. This caesura (also known as the
‘ penthemimeral ’ and ‘ masculine ' caesura) occurs, as its

name indicates (lit. (ξ’), between the thesis and arsis of the ,ἦ

third foot, thus:

I. Qualibet. illa tuo Ι sententia semper in ore.

The Latin hexameter uses this caesura more frequently than
all the others put together. The main advantages of it are,
(1) that it is strong and distinct ; (2) that it allows the use of
either a dactyl or a spondee in the third foot 3 (3) that it al-

 

ways produces conflict in the third foot 3 (4) that, with this · 4

caesura, conflict in the second, and especially in the fourth
foot is more easily obtained. In the example quoted (1),
conflict occurs only in the third foot and is produced by the
caesura. The comparative frequency of such verses in the
satires of Horace and Juvenal is a mark of the freedom of
the department.

Conflict in the second and fourth feet is produced by mak-
ing the end of any word but a monosyllable coincide with the
thesis in each case, thus:

II. Consilium Ι dedimus Ι Sullae Ι privatus ut altum.

In the large majority of cases, therefore, the regular ‘pen-

themimeral ' caesura is accompanied by one or both of these ἐ

secondary caesurae. They are named, from their positione in
the verse, the‘ trithemimeral' (semiternaria, (ἵ) and the
= ‘hephthemimeral’ (semiseptenaria, (ᾖ ’.)

Juvenal himself belongs to a group of poets who make ⁴

a larger use of the penthemimeral caesura. The others are
Ovid, Persius, and Claudian.¹

b. Caesam seffliseptenaria. Next to the ‘ penthemimeral,’
but at a long interval, the caesura most used by the Roman
poets is the ‘hephthemimeraL’ This should always be ac·
