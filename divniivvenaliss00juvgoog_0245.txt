sunm 1v 45

1-27. Crispinus is again the subject of my satire and must osten be,
because os his unspeakable crimes, At present, however, Ι speak ot
something less serious, He bought a mullet at an outrageous price and
for his own use. For the same sum the upstart might have bought a
farm.

1. crispinus: see ἓ 19 and note on l. 108. The former attack is not
preserved, for it can scarcely be the mere mention in 1, 26 f. See ξ 11.ι

tum: Sen. Nat. Quaest. 1, 17, 4 redimendum esse virtutibus quicquid
corpori deesset.

3. solaque libidine fortem 6 A, 25 (p. 41) hic erit in lecto fortissimus ,·
cf. Shakespeare, Coriolanus, 111, 1 ‘ Their mutinies and revoltS, wherein
they shewed Most valor, spoke not sor them.'

4. deliciae: ‘a ladies' man’ ; cf. 6, 473 see g 129, a and note on 10,
291. viduas ι ‘ unmarried women.’ To Crispinus none but forbidden
and carefully guarded fruits are sweet3 cf. Aesch. Suppl. 1009 τέρειν’

were the badge of the sacred office ; cf. Ovid, Fast. v1, 4571. nullaque
dicetur vittas temerasse sacerdos hoc duce, nec viva defodietur humo.

10. terram subitura: the Vestal Cornelia was buried alive for unchas-
tity by Domitian in 91 ΑΛ). But Juvenal does not refer to this ; he seems
merely to be ret-ailing town gossip.² The participle indicates no more
than the natural consequence of the act if it were proved ; see g 118, d.

11. levioribus: explained by 1. 15. For the ellipsis, see g 138, b.
