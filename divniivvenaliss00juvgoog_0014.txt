reliable biographical detail. This is true of Juvenal, not,
however, from any lack of evidence bearing on the subject,
but because of the very uncertain character of most of the

sources on which we must- ultimately depend. These sources ·

may be considered in the following order: Ancient biog-
raphies, an inscription from Aquinum, references in Mar-

of Juvenal are as numerous as they are untrustworthy.¹

appear to be based to a considerable extent on doubtful in-

from manifest absurdities. In spite of many variations and
discrepancies, all these biographies go back to one ancient·
source ² ; nearest to that source is the following vita, which
in style and subject-matter is superior to the rest, and seems
‘itself to be the authority for most of the statements found
in the others.'
