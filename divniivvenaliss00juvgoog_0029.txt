in literature Juvenal mentions Lucan,² Quintilian,² and
Statius,' but has no reference either to his friend Martial
or to the other famous writers of the period. But, apart
from such names as represent well-known personS, there are
many names, appearing in Juvenal alone 01111 both Juvenal
and Martial, which are unknown from other sources⁴ For
example, Matho in 1, 32 is a lawyer, in 7, 129 a bankrupt‚
· 111 11, 34 a mouthing orator3 in these, however, as in many
other similar cases, there is nothing to show that the same
individual 18 11108111. 011 1110 1111010, 11 8001118 likely that
those names which cannot be connected with persons known
to history are, at least in many instanceS, purely fictitious
and were taken at random 10 represent certain more or less
clearly defined types*

25. Juvenal’s treatment of the satura. In devoting
himself 10 1110 composition of satire Juvenal claims to be 8
follower of Lucilius and of Horace⁶3 but, while preserving
the tradition of the 110118111110111111 00118111 respects un-'
broken, he developed some features of the satura in a way
entirely his own. He did not allow himself the variety
of metros employed by Ennius, Lucilius, Varro, and Petro·
nius; but, following the example of Horace, confined him-
self to the dactylic hexameter. And yet the hexameter of
Juvenal is a very different verse from that of Lucilius or
even of Horace. Instead of the rather rough and careless
metre of the earlier satiristS, with its frequent elisions
and metrical licenses, we find in Juvenal the more polished,
stately, and sonorous rhythm which was characteristic
of the epic poetry of his time and which was based on
imitation of Vergil. The medley of subjects treated, which

⁴ Friedlander (ed. p, 100), arguing from the assumption that 8 recum-ing 1181110 in
Juvenal regularly indicates the same person each time, comes to the conclusion that the
satirist usually introduces real persons and gives them thelr true names. But this
assumption ls not warranted by 1110 evidence.
