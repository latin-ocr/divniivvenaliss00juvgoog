notasset, ac statim per honorem militiae quamquam octogenarius urbe
summotus est missusque ad praefecturam cohortis in extrema parte
tendentis Aegypti. id supplicii genus placuit, ut levi atque ioculari
delicto par esset. verum intra brevissimum tempus angore et taedio

periit.

This vita,¹ added by a later hand at the end of the codem
Pithoeanus‚ and found also in a considerable number of other
MSS„ was probably compiled in the fourth or fifth century by
the commentator known as the Probus of Valla.' Most of its
statements seem to have no better foundation than untrust·
worthy tradition and unwarranted inference from passages
in the satires.' The first sentence, however, contains details
which could not easily be inferred from the poet's works,⁴
and, judged from the point of view of expression, may well
be derived from some authority much nearer the time of
Juvenal.

7. The inscription of Aquinum. From the neighbor-
hood of Aquinum comes an inscription,⁶ existing now only
in copy, dedicated to Ceres by one Juvenal who is generally
believed to be identical with the author of the satires.⁶ It

reads as follows ε

⁸ The reference to Egypt is probably due to infer-enee from the fifteenth satire (note
on 15, 45) ς ct. the expression sememmbm militiolis tumentem with 7, 88 1¹.

⁴ But see F. Ι. Merchant, Am. Jour. Phil„ xxn, 1901, pp. 51 ff„ who tries to show
that even these details might have been dedneed from the satiras.
