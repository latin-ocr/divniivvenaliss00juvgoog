The following digression on legacy-hunting (note on 3, 129) 15 quite 111
the style of Juvenal, who takes little pains to avoid such dislocations ;
see ἐξ 36 and 141.

parvolus aula luderet Aenea-s ,⁰ see ἓ 26.

141. Hycale: concubina (gloss p). As the offspring oi a concubine
could 1101 legally inherit, Trebius, still represented as rich, might have a
number of such children, who would only be welcomed by Virro and
presented with little 81115.ι

142. ipse: see 11016 011 1. 30. loquaci . . . nido: probably a reminis-

escae ,· 566 ἓ 26.

143. viridem thoraca: prasinam vestem vel tunicam (gloss p). As
Juvenal uses viridia oi 1116 factio prasina in the Circus (note on 11, 198),

147. boletus 2 Mart. 1, 20, 4 boletum qualem Claudius edit, edas

¹ By the assumption that Mycale—apparently a slave's name—is a concubine, Virro's
attitude to the children 15 explained (50 Friedl. and Buecheler). According 10 Mayor,
however, who is followed by some more recent editors, Mycale 15 the wife of Trebius,
