SATIBE IV
m arnul. commu.

It is difficolt to believe that the parts of which this satire is com-
posed were originally intended by the author to form one harmonious
whole ; for harmonious in any strict sense they certainly are not. The
first part (ll. 1-27), which looks like a portion of a satire levelled at the
upstart Egyptian, and the last part (ll. 37-154), which describes'the assem-
bly and proeeedings of the imperial council, are joined in the loosest
fashion by lines 28436) Βο1 whatever may have been the original in-
tention, we are not justified in assuming that any other hand than that
of the author arranged the satire as it stands, For similar lack of har-
mony in structure, see Satires 1, 7, and 11.

Whether Domitian really did summon his advisers to plan for the dis-
posal of a fish may be doubted, notwithstanding J uvenal’s assertion (l.

35 res vera amiur), though it is not inherently improbable. It seems·

more likely that the present satire is a burlesque account of some meet-
ing held at Domitian’s Alban villa, such as that which took place before
the war with the Chatti, 83 Aa). (cf. 1. 14¹7)‚⁴ a meeting described, of
course in serious vein, by Statius in his De Bello Germanico, os which
the scholiast (Valla) on l. 94 quotes the following verses z

lumina Nestorei mitis prudentia Crispi

et Fabius Veiento—potentem signat utrumque
purpura, ter memores implerunt nomine fastos—
et prope Caesareae confinis Acilius aulae.⁸

¹ Auditor, which was probably the reading ot P, though given up by Buech. (1893),
has since been defended by Polstorff (1896) and Duff (1898), and is now read by Owen
(1902). It is certainly not lectio difficilior, but makes far better sense than adiutor (po);
for, as Polstorff remarks, non adiutorem optant poetae, sed auditorem.

² There is here no reference to the soldier's boot (note on 1. 248), for caliqae were worn
also by countrymen and even by womeng cf. Edict. Dioclet. xx, 5a, 6, 10 with Blflm-
ner's note (p. 126) and see W. v. Christ, l. l. p. 142.

² For a different view, see A. Gercke, Gott. gel. Anz„ 1896, pp. 981 ff.

⁴ On July 22ᾱ, 82 Δ.11., Domitian held a meeting adhibitis utriusque ordinis splendidis
viris (c.1.L. xx, 5420).

⁵ Fabricius Veiento (note on l. 113) is called Fabius, doubtless to mark him as a man of
cantion and forethought like Fabius Cunctator, the great opponent of Hannibal. See
F. Buecheler, Rhein. Mus.. xxxtx, 1884, pp. 283 1. and S. Gsell, Emi mr le rique de
l'empereur Domitia, 1893, p. 61, note 6.
