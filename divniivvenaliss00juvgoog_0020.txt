explained as a reminiscence of the well-known name M.
Iunius Brutus,² With regard to the date of J uvenal's birth
there has been wide 'divergence of opinion.' Is we accept
the statement of the ancient biographies that he practised

lation from the time when the satires began to be published,
we may arrive approximately at the date sought. If the
first book was published about the year 105, and Juvenal
‘was then in middle life, he must have been born not long

his birthplace was Aquinum in Latium, the town near

class precludes the possibility that he was himself a freedman's son.
