detail. But we should not suppose that in Rome every man
was a Nero and every woman a J ulia 3 for Juvenal doubtless
chose the most striking examples to illustrate and enforce
his argument. History does not often occupy herself with ¹
simple virtue, but she has fort-unately given us refreshing ,
glimpses of sterling manhood, pure and noble womanhood, ἶ
and domestic peace‚¹ which serve to show that private life
in the first century was not in all quarters so degenerate as
Juvenal alone might lead us to suppose.

23. Lack of moral perspective. What strikes us as
most peculiar in Juvenal's attitude toward moral questions is
his lack of perspective3 his fiercest indignation is aroused
by the slightest faults.' The youth who squanders his
resources on fast horses is just as bad as the husband who
fattens on the proceeds of his wife's dishonor—perhaps worse,
because he actually holds the reins himself' 3 and the most
unspeakable and unnatural vices are far less monstrous than
the public appearance of a nobleman as a gladiator.⁴ κ
Nothing is more evident than' that Juvenal lacked a fine
discrimination in moral, questions and made· little effort to
distinguish varying degrees of guilt.

24. Use of personal names. The large number of per-
sonal names in the satires makes it necessary to raise the ⁴¹
question whether or not Juvenal always refers to real per-
sonS. Of course, many well-known historical characters
figure in these pages: Seianus‚⁶ the powerful praefectus
praetorio of Tiberius3 Pallas‚⁶ PosideS‚⁷ and Narcissus,⁸ ’
the freedmen of Claudius3 Lucusta⁹ the poisoner‚ Tigel-
linus ¹⁰ the boon companion of Nem, Crispinus ¹¹ the court
favorite, Rutilius Gallicus¹² the praefectus urbi, and other
prominent figures of the reign of Domitian. Of men eminent
