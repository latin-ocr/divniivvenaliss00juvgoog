XXX INTRODUGTION

34. Scholia PIthoeana. The oldest commentary on
Juvenal of which we have any knowledge seems to have been
written in the latter part of the fourth century.¹ This was
probably the commentary quoted by Gr. Valla, in his edition
of Juvenal published at Venice in 1486, though the MS. used
by him is no longer extant. In this MS„ which ended abruptly
at Sat. 8, 198, the author of the commentary was called
Probus,² and is now usually referred to as the Probus of Valla,
inasmuch as he is known only by the copious quotations in
Valla’s edition. A comparison of ι these extracts with the
scholia preserved in P and als0, without the text, in a MS. of
St. Gall (n. 870) shows that both come from the same good old
source, though less valuable additions have been made in the
latter. These annotatione, now known as the Scholia Pithoe-
ana, have transmitted much useful information, especially ⁴1
in regard to persons and places mentioned in Juvenal, and
they are of the highest importance for the constitution of the
text, preserving, as they sometimes do, readings which ante-
date all of the extant MSS.⁸ ’

35. Scholia of CornutuS. Far more voluminous and for
the most part of little value are the scholia traditionally
attributed to one Cornutus.⁴ This commentary, which is
found with little variation in the inferior MSS. from the ninth
century onward, now and then offers a good explanation, but,
on the whole, abounds in absurdities, and in dealing with
Roman life, literature, and antiquities often displays the
grossest ignorance.‘
