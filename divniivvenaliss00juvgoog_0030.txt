was accepted as such by Horace, Juvenal also recognized,¹
and in this respect he conformed to the practice of his prede-
0888018. 111 1118 0888, however, the general effect is so modi·
fied by the constant presence of the spirit of censure, espe-
cially in the earlier bookS, which alone 0811 be said to contain
real satires, that we are not so much impressed by the variety
of subject as by the uniformity of treatment. The clement of
dialogue, als0, which was quite regular in the early stages ¹
and was largely introduced by Horace, takes a less prominent
place in Juvenal. The ninth satire is the only real dialogue,
the third is a long monologue with the necessary introduc-
11011 and conclusion, and fragments of dialogue are found in
the first.² Thus we see that while dealing independently
with the satura and developing 11 10 801118 extent along lines
peculiar to himself, he was yet not entirely unmindsul of the
example of his predecessors in this field.

· 26. Reminiscences of other poets. Like most other
poets of his time, Juvenal was doubtless a diligent student
of literature, both Greek and Roman. His use o'f Homeric
names and comparisons ⁸ and his occasional reminiscences of
Lucilius, Ovid, Petronius, Seneca,⁴ and other writers, which
are pointed out from time to time in the commentary, ,
furnish good ground for this statement. But there are
authors whose greater influence on the satirist calls for
special remark 3 namely, Vergil,⁶ Horace,⁸ and Martial.⁷
When we remember that by the latter part of the first cen-
tury Vergil and Horace were the text-books of every Roman
schoolboy,⁸ we are not surprised to find echoes of these
poets everywhere in the literature of the period. In the
