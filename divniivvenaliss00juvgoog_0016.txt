Χ INTBODUOTION

“ In honor of Ceres D. Iunius Iuvenalis, tribune of the
first cohort of Dalmatians, duumvir quinquennalis, priest of
the deified Vespasian, vowed and dedicated (this offering)
at his own expense.'' In favor of this identification it may
be observed that the satirist closely associates himself with
Aquinum² and mentions Ceres in the same connection. Is
we may assume, moreover, that Juvenal, like most men of his
time, saw service in the army in his youth, the many refer-
ences to military life in the satires thus find a ready expla-
nation. But in the absence of the praenomen it must be
acknowledged that we are on uncertain ground3 for the
municipal official of the inscription might as well be the
father, brother, or some other relative of the poet.

8,. Martial. A third source of information is Martial,
the only writer of the first three centuries who mentions the
name of Juvena1.² That the two poets were on terms of
friendship, and even of intimacy, seems a saie inference from
the three epigrams that come in question.' In the seventh
book, published in the year 92, Juvenal is called facun-
caes: which without doubt refers only to his ability as an
orator3 for all signs point to his having published none of the
satires until a much later date.⁶ About the year 100, after
Martial had finally retired from Rome to his native place in
Spain, he writes to Juvenal as follows z

xxi, who believe that ⁶ the local magnate of Aquinum was not the poet himself, but a
kinsmau by blood or adoption.' Cf. E. Htlbner, Woch. f. klass. Phil„ vr, 1889, col.

² 3, 319 ; cf. 99 12, 18.

² The only other references to Juvenal in Latin literature—aeide from quotations
or reminiscences of the satires during the fourth and following centuries (cf. §ffb-are
made by Sldonius Apollinaris, lx, 269 ff„ who menti0ns Ovid's banishment in the
same sentence with that of Juvenal (cf. 515), by Ammianus, xxvm, 4, 14, who informs
us that Juvenal was diligently studied in the fourth century, and by Rutilius Namatianus,
1, 604, who merely mentions the name of the satirist.

⁴ Facundus is, of course, frequently used of poeta, cf. Vollmer's nota on Stat. Su.
