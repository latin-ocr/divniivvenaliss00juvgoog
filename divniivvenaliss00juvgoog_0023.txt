have been intrusted to a man of eighty, and the satires them-
selves indicate with sufficient clearness that during the latter
‘half of his life Juvenal was almost constantly in Rome. In
, the reign of Domitian, however, he may have been banished
for the reason assigned ² or for some other cause unknown to
ηε, or his appointment to some distant post during the term
of his military service may have given rise to the story. On
the whole, it seems possible that the tradition of the exile
ι rests on good foundation, while the statements of time, place,
and cause are merely deductions from various passages of the
satireS.²

16. Death. The exact date of J uvenal's death cannot be
determined. We have seen that he was writing as late as the
year 128 ; if we may accept as well founded the tradition in
several of the vitae that he lived to be eighty or more years
of age, his decease may be placed in the latter half of the
next decade (135-140).

17. Knowledge of philosophy. Though the poems os
Juvenal do not furnish much information with regard to
the life of their author, they do offer a substantia] basis on
which to form an estimate of his mental equipment and of
some aspects of his character. In the first place, his philo-
sophical knowledge is of the most elementary kind. By
nature he was not much given ⁴to reflection, but was pre-
eminently an observer who regarded the passions and activi-
ties of men with the greatest interest.' Hence we are not
surprised to learn that he never studied the doctrines of the
philosophica] schoOIS,⁴ though, like most rhetoricians, hey
shows a superficial acquaintance with their chief tenete.
For Juvenal, however, philosophy was little more than the

tradition and could find in Juvenal’s life no place for a period of exile.
