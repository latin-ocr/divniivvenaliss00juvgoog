The sphere again is Lucretius and satire. Lucretius, probably
after Ennius, neglecte the rule of a proper name. On th
other hand, most of his examples occur in passages which
are not epic, but dogmatic. Here also Juvenal imitates the
freedom os Lucretius. Only 6 of his 25 cases are proper
names.

One line ending in a word os six syllables (7, 218) is found
in Juvenal (but see the note). Manitius quotes three
others from Lucretius and four or five more only from the
later poets.

154. To begin a new sentence or clause at the fifth soot, l
as in 2, 15,

Atque supercilio brevior coma. verius erge,

was usually avoided by the best poets. It occurs in Juvenal
with some frequency‚ generally sor effect, as in 1, 149, etc.
155. Elision ¹ is the law os the Latin language. Is it was
desirable to avoid it, the sentence had to be so arranged as
to prevent concurrence of vowels‚ Frequency of elision and
sreedom in its use was characteristic of the spoken language‚
and os comedy and satire, the two literary departments most
nearly allied to it. Ennius allowed harsh elision, but the
influence of Homer, and possibly of the Saturnian, made
his use of elision very limited. Lucilius had a great many,
but far less than comedy. Lucretius followed LuciliuS‚-
Catullus followed Ennius. Vergil avoided harsh elisions,
but otherwise is notable for his freedom. Ovid largely re-
duced elision, and the process os diminution finally reached
the vanishing point in some os the later Latin poetS.
Juvenal shows a freedom which may be generally defined
as due to his department, less, than that os earlier satire, far
greater, than that of contemporary epic or epigram. Other-
wise, with one or two exceptions, the following figures of
Eskuche represent about the usual relative proportione :
