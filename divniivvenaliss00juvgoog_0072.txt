which is oftener a proper name. Ennius follows 111 1116 foot-
steps, and the same is true for Lucretius, except that the
number has been very much reduced. The versus spondiazon-3,
however, was a special affectation of the school of Catullus,
and they finally fixed the law that it must end in a proper
name of four syllableS, zze. a dispondee. Moreover, with a few
notable exceptione, such as Appenninus, the name must be
Greek. This law remained for the rest of thediterature, but,
after Catullus, the line itself lingere‘d chiefly in Vergil and
Ovid. It is not found 111 the satires of Horace, and in the
first-century epicis very rare. Persius in 1, 92 ridicules it
as an affectation. λ

than thirty caseS, a larger proportion than is found in any
poet after Catullus himself. Moreover, he not only does not
bind himself to the Catullian law of the final word, but also
disregardsthe tendency of the earlier Homeric type as ex-
hibited in Ennius and Lucretius, In all of this he stands
alone, and both the frequency and the sreedom of this line
seem to indicate a purpose in its use. Juvenal appears to
have felt that the versus spondiacus, in spite of its affecta-
tion by those later poets whom he despised, really belonged
to high epic. The one purpose which a majority of his ex-
amples have in common is emphasis. His mood may be
serious, sardonic, mock-heroic, or what not, and the purpose
of the emphasis will vary accordingly, but the residuum is
emphasis, Moreover, the freedom of cadence reflects the
variation of mood and seems to have been suggested by it.

old Rome) 3 3, 17 (sneering Ρ) ; 3, 120 (these most worship-
