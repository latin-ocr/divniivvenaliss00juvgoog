153. Agreement. It is an universal rule of artistic
poetry 'that whatever liberties we may take with a verse, the

Ι end of it should be well marked and clearly reflect the type.

Conflict has a certain tendency to obscure the rhythm 3 more·
over, the hexameter should be brought to a restsul close.

Ἴ The law-of conflict, therefore, ceases with the fourth foot,

and for the last two feet agreement of verse-ictus and word-
accent is sought. From this point os view the favorite types

3 are:

A dissyllable preceded by a trisyllable at least, or, at most,
a word which shall not go back of the fourth arsis :

I. AeacuS, unde alius furtivae Ι devehat aurum
Cur tamen hoc potius libeat deleurrere campo
Hos animos? neque enim loculis comiltantibus itur„

A trisyllable preceded by a dissyllable at least, or, at

‚ most, a word which shall not go back of the fourth arsis ε

II. Quidquid agunt homineS, votum timor Ι ira voluptas
Navigio montem ascendit, sorltisque poposcit
Crispinus Tyrias umero revolcante lacernas.

A frequent sub-variety of 11 is illustrated by

Consilium dedimus Sullae prilvatus ut altum,

εἶθ. re‘placement of the trisyllable by a dissyllable preceded
by a proclitic monosyllable.

Over 9056 of all Latin hexameters end in these two forms.
