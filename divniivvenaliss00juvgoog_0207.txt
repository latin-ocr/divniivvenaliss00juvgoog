to his size ; see note on 5, 30. For the ablative, see 595. magni
delator amici ε the attempt to identify is fruitless ; indeed, it seems quite
possible that no one in particular is meant-‚¹ From the time of Tibe-
rius informers swarmed at Rome. In spite of efforts to repress them
they were a most deadly instrument in the hands of tyrants for the de·
struction of the rich and noble. May‘nus indicates high rank also in 3,

36. Baebius Massa, procurator of Africa in the year 70, later procon-
sul in Baetica, was accused of extortion and condemned about the year
93. He and Mettius Carus were noted informers during the reign of
Domitian. LatinuS, an actor os the same period, and a savorite of the
emperor, must also have been known as an informer.² The delator is
so dreaded that even men of his own class stand in awe of him and
Latinus sends his partner Thymele (cf. 8, 197) on a secret mission to
appease him. Cf. Apoll. Sid. Ep. V, 7, 1 Izi sunt, quos timent etiam qui
timentur.

unit being the as, divided into twelve unciae. Heres em asse is there-
fore heir to the whole, heres ex uncia, heir to one twelfth. The di-
