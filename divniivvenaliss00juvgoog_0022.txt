soldier by experience„ His indignation at the promotion of
the unworthy to important military posts,¹ his familiar refer-
ences to centurions and other officers,² as well as his evident
intimacy with the details of camp life,⁸ all point in that
direction. He displays, t00, a knowledge of various out-
lying provinces of the empire,⁴ especially of Britain) which
is easily explained on the assumption that he had visited
different parts of the world in a military capacity.⁶ It seems 3
likely, then, that Juvenal had served in the army, though, if
we leave the inscription out of consideration, there is nothing
to suggest his rank or the duration of his service.

15. Banishment. One of the most perplexing questions
in connection with the life of Juvenal is that of his banish- ³
ment.' The vitae agree that he was banished on account · of 1
verses directed against the actor Paris, a savorite of Domi· *

irati histrionis emal and expect, to be understood. ¹⁰ But while
they agree as to the fact and the cause, the ancient biogra· ἵ
phies differ widely in regard to time and place. Some say that ’
at the age of eighty years the satirist was sent under pretext of ὲ
8 military command to a distant part of Egypt 3 another says ,
11181 he was despatched to Scotland, where he soon died of
chagrin. According to one story, Trajan was the emperor ¹
who ordered his ,banishment3 according to otherS, Nero or
Domitian. With so many contradictory accounts and no
convincing evidence, it is of course impossible to be sure of 1
our ground. But we do not need evidence to convince us
that no important command on a frontier of the empire can
