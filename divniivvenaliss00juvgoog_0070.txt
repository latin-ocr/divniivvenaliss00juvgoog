is rendered less exceptional by the fact that enthymema is a
Greek word.

d. Bucolic diaeresiS, especially with a spondee in ,the
fourth foot, is common to the point of monotony in Catullus
and Lucretius. Avoidance of it is noticeable in Vergil, and
it was used less and less by the more careful among later

poets, owing to the fact that it made conflict in the fourth
foot all but impossible. Compare:

VIII. Martis et Aeoliis vicinum Ι rupibus antrum.

Juvenal in 1, 5 and ’ἴ shows the only way in which this
diaeresis could be combined with conflict in the fourth foot.
The frequency of this diaeresis, especially with the more ob-
jectionable spondee in the fourth foot, is a notable charac-
teristic of Juvenal's verse. The suecession of them in ιο,-
153 f. seems to have been for a special purpose.

148. J uvenal's use of caesura, speaking in general, may be
best appreciated by reading a long passage aloud. It will be
seen that the variety and freedom of satire have been adapted
with great skill to the purposes of declamation.

 

149. Dactyls and spondees„ The Latin language was ’
naturally rich in spondees, In the hexameter of epic and ι

elegy there was a long struggle to avoid them, which culmi-
nated in the light and graceful verse of Ovid. The conver-

sational tone of satire admitted them more freely. But ,

even here the effect of chronology is visible. Juvenal’s 4456

of daotyls in the first four feet is slightly larger than that of ¹

Vergil. Persius and Lucan belong in the same class

150. Schemata.¹ The possible combinations of dactyls
and spondees in the hexameter (particularly, of course, in
the first four feet) were known as the schemata. All the sche-
mata are found in the Latin poetS, but the favorites for the
literature are das-3, about 15 ss ; dsds, about 12 55 ; ddss, about
11 56 3 ads-3, about 10 ᾖ. The least desired are sddd, about 2 ᾖ,
