inside pageS, however, were smeared with wax, usually black in color, on
which the writing was traced with ·a sharp point (stilus). Such tablets
were used, as here, for memoranda, tor wills (2, 58 ; 4, 19; 6, 601;
12, 1233 14, 55), for brief letterS‚ and sor business purposeS. Many are
extant, especially from Pompeii and from Dacia.⁸
