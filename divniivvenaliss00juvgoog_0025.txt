mythology 3 he regards the stories of the infernal regions as
utterly unworthy of belief,² and never takes seriously a de·
based or anthropomorphic conception of the gods.² Foreign
culte, so popular at Rome in his day, met with his strong
disapproval ’ς and especially J udaism, with its more mysteri-

19. Hatred of foreignerS. One of the most marked

vices were not relieved by any virtue,¹¹ may possibly, through
his great influence with Domitian, have been the cause of
disappointment or loss to the satirist, who, now that the im-
perial savorite is no longer to be dreaded, gives full expres-
sion to his loathing and contempt.¹'
