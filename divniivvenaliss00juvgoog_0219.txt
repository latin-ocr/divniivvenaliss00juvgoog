137. ds. . ‚orbibust connect closely with una, not with comedunt,· see
ἓ 97, d. On extravagance in this regard, see note on l. 75.

138. patrimonia: ‘whole fortuneS,' as in Seneca, Rem. Fort. 16, 7 au·
riculis utrimque patrimonia bina dependeant. In Juvenal the word
commonly means wealth, not necessarily inherited wealth, as 7, 113 ; 10, .
13 ; 12, 50; 14, 116.

189. parasitus: see intr. to the fifth satire. istane see 561, b.

140. luxuriae sordes: this is what Pliny meant when he described his
host as sm·didum simul et sumptuosum (Ep. 11, 6, 1) and said that noth-

ing ought more earnestly to be avoided than istam luxuriae et sordium, ’

novam societatem (ib. ἓ ’7); cf. ib. 1v, 2, 5 ut est in stamma avaritia
sumptuosus (ἓ 131). quanta est gula: Mart. V, 70, 5 0 quanta eet
qula ‚centies comesse ,· see ἐξ 8, 26. Gula here as in 5, 94; 11, 39; 14,
10 means gluttony, but in 5, 158 ; 15, 90 it means a glutton.

141. ponit: ‘ serves up’3 Pers r, 53 calidum ecia ponere memem- Mart.
v111‚ 22, 1 ponis mihi, Gallice, porcum. This use os ponere is probably
colloquial in its origin. See ἓ 44.ι

142. poena praesens: Plin. N. Η. x1v‚ 142 hino (i.e. from drunkenness)
pallor et genae pendulae . . . , quae sit poena praecem, furiales somni ,· cf.
Plautus' praesens pecunia, ‘ cash down.’ The dangerous custom of tak-
ing a hot bath immediately after excessive eating was often practised in
Rome, because it was believed to aid digestion. The emperor Elagabalus
once gave a dinner os twenty-two couroeS, aiter each of which the guests

bathea·

148. turgidus: Persius describes in detail the deadly effects os this
aster—dinner bath, 3, 98-106 tumidus hic epulis atque albo ventre lava-
tur, etc. crudum: ‘undigested,' as in Celsus 1, 2, and 1v, 18 ; in 3,
233, inperfectus has the same meaning.'

144. hino: on the omission os the verb, see ἓ 138, b. intestata:
‘ not attested,’ ‘ not witnessed,’ from negative in and testatus in its com-
mon sense of ‘attested,’ ‘well known‚’ ‘evident.’ Martial means the
same thing when he says immodicis brevis est aetas et rara senectus (vr,

29. ’7) ; cs. 4, 97 prodiyio par est in nobilitate senectus. Others interpret
intestata according to its usual meaning ‘ having made no will,’ and re-

⁸ Crudum, the correction or p, is supported by Phocas, a Roman grammarian ot the
arth century, and by the scholiast on Persius (3, 98). J. D. Duff, however, following S. G.
Owen (class Rev„ xi, 1897, p. 400) readswith PH crudus, which Is often used of per·
sons in the active sense of ⁴ not digesting,' i.e. ⁸ dyspeptic,' ⁸ suffering from indigestion,’
eg. 6, 2⁰3 ς Hor, Sat. 1, 5, 49. This reading derives some support from Hor. Epist. 1, 6,
⁶1 crudi tumidique lavemur: but pavonem needs the quamying adjective and the posi·
tion or tumidus seems to connect it with both clauses3 see ς 124.
