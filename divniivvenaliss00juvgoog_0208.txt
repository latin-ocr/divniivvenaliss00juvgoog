in 12 so. to Augustus and Rome.¹ At the oratorical contest here
instituted by Caligula the most unsuccesssul competitors suffered rather
severe treatment; Suet. Cal. 20 eos autem, qui maxime displicuissent,

47. prostantis: again 3, 65; 6, 123 ; 9, 24; stare in the same sense, 10,

Africa. Pliny, Ep. 11, 11, gives a full account of the case, in which he

thinks of a different person because from l. 30 he regards the satit-ist as standing on the

side the city. consistency in such matters is not characteristic of Juvenal. See A.
Gercke, l. l. p. 979. -
