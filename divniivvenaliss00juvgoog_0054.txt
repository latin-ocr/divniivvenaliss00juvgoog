(four times), an more frequent (twenty-four times). Worthy
of note are the following ε

a. An is used for num or -ne in the simple indirect ques-
tion and in the first member of the disjunctive question : e. q.
7, 141 f. respicit. . ,an tibi servi octe, decem comites, an post
te sella ; 13, 202 f. quaerebat. . ,απ hoe itti facinus suaderet ;
6, 387,567 3 15, 89, etc. This does not occur in the best
prose, but is found in Plautus and Terence, and is com-
mon in the Silver period.¹

b. Anne is Juvenal’s regular substitute for num in the
simple direct question ε e.q. 4, 78 anne aliud tum praefecti P
7, 179 f. anne serenum expectet? 7, 199 f. anne atiud quam
sidus? 10, 207 3 15, 122 ; similarly in the simple indirect
question in Plin. N. H. 11, 95 ad dubitationem est adductus
anne hoe saepius fieret. In Cicero anne is used only in the
second member of a disjunctive question.²

e. Numquid is used for num in the indirect question as
well as in the direct: 2, 51 numquid nos aqimus causas ? 11,
56 f. experiere hodie numquid pulcherrima.. ‚non praestem.
In the indirect question numquid is rare and colloquial, and
the force of the indefinite may usually be felt, aq. Cic. Att.
ΧΠ, 8 3 Petron. 9, 102.8

Subordination

99. Gausal. Siquidem, originally conditional, sometimes
introduces what is practically a causal clause with verb in
the indicative: aq. 6, 620 f. ,minus erqo nocens erit Aqrip-
pinae boletus, siquidem unius praecordia pressit ille senis ;
12, 106 f. Caesaris armentum nulli servire paratum private,
siquidem Tyrio parere solebant Hannibali. This word was
rarely used before Cicer0, was avoided by Curtius, but is
found fourteen times in Suetonius and frequently afterward.
