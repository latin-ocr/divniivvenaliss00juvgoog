satires of Juvenal are found reminiscences of word and
phrase, osten with the thought or point of view quite
changed, borrowed comparisons, parodieS, metrical and
other peculiarities, all of which point to the satirist’s
thorough familiarity with these writers and sometimes even
consciens imitation Α of them.¹ But there is none with
whom Juvenal seems to have had so close a literary con-
nection as with Martial. When the two authors are read
together, as they should be, coincidences of thought and
expression crowd upon the attention in such numbers that it
is impossible to escape the conclusion that the one was deeply
influenced by the other. We have seen that the two poets
were on terms of intimate friendship,² so that Juvenal must
have been perfectly familiar with the epigramS, the last of
which were published in the year 101-102, some time, in all
probability, before he had written any of the satires.⁸ We
are not to suppose, then, that the numerous striking parallels
are on the whole merely accidental and caused by a common
environment,⁴ or that the two poets “virtually worked

together '² ⁶ ; but rather we are led to conclude that Juvenal, Α
· sometimes unconsciously, but often intentionally, allowed

the familiar thoughts and even the words of his friend to
reappear in his own pages. As a rule, however, he seems to
have avoided expressing the same thought in the same way
as Martial, though now and then he borrows Martial's wordS,
giving thern a new meaning or adapting them to a different
point of view.⁶

edition of Juvenal, p. 46. '

⁸ This view of Η. Nettleship (Lect. and Essays, Second Series, 1895, p. 131) would
involve ns in great chronological difficulties.
