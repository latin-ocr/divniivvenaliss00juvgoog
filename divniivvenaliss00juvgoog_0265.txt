SATIRE VII

THE DISCOURAGEMENTS 01³· LITERARY mm

Judged by common literary standards, this satire is lacking in har·
monious structure and due proportion‚ but these saults are not unusual

in Juvenal (ἓ 36). Friedl. argues that the body ot the poem (11. 36-243),
which deals with the inadequate return for intellectual effort—five dif-

ferent professions are taken as types—was composed in the reign of
Trajan, but that the introduction (ll. 1-21), which points to better pros-
pects for poets through the emperor’s favor, was written after the acces-
sion of Hadrian (117 Α.1).), and badly joined to the earlier piece by 11.

22-35. Granting, as we must, that the Caesar of lines 1-21 is Hadrian, ·

who favored the pursuit of literature (g 10), we are not on that account
obliged to assume an earlier date for ‘the composition' os the rest. It
seems more likely that early 'in Hadrian’s reign Juvenal wrote this satire,

expressing his hope based on the imperial favor, but describing condi-
tions as they were and had been.² “

1-35. No longer need poets give up literary pursuitS, and eke out a
livelihood in baser occupations; an indulgent emperor is ready to be
their patron. Let them not expect support from any other source ; for
the rich bestow nothing but praise, leaving the poet to meet old age in
poverty and discouragement.
