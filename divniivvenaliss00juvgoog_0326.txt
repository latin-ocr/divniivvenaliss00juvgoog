SATIRE XIII

The satirist writes to his friend Calvinus to console him for the loss 01
a sum of money, of which he has been defrauded. “ You should not
take to heart the loss of a small sum in times like these, when fraud is
common and honesty is rare (ll. 1-70). Men receive one’s money, and
then swear by all the gods they never had it, not deterred by a penalty
which comes slowly 01· may never come at all (ll. '‘ll-1 19). And you have
no real reason to complain, for many greater crimes are committed
