PREFAOE

ἶ IN preparing this edition Ι have had two distinct aims,
l to furnish the student who takes up Juvenal for the first
time with everything necessary to the understanding of the
lauthor and his place in literature, and to offer to teachers
[and advanced studente guidance and suggestion for a more
ldetailed study of the Satires. Both Introduction and Gom-
-mentary are accompanied by a series of footnotes, in which
’ are contained alternative interpretations and critical discus-
sions, as well as occasional references to standard sources and

to recent literature bearing on Juvenal.
In the constitution of the text I have made use of all avail-

 

 

lable critical materials, and in the case of the most difficult
1 passages have usually stated in the notes the reasons for my
preference. Apart from matters of punctuation the 1116611111-
portant places 1n which Ihave ventured to differ from the last
edition' of Buecheler (1893) are 2, 1063 3, 322, 6, 167, 270,
’415, 7, 12, 16, 24, ιο, 295, 11, 148, 14, 113, 122, 216, 217,
15, 7. 111 these passages, with the exception of 6, 270, 415,
7, 16, 24, 10, 295, 11, 148, 14, 216, 217, Ι find myselt' in
§accord with Mr. S. G. Owen, whose Persius and Juvenal ap-
peared several months after the text of the present edition was
electrotyped. ·

ὲ Ι shall not attempt to make any detailed statement of my
lindebtedness to various sources of information3 anyone who
reads with care the Introduction and Gommentary will rare] y
bc uninformed on this point. Among the commentatore the
most helpful have been Mayor, Friedlander‚ and Duff, though
most of the others from the time of Domizio Galderino to the
present have been consulted. I gladly acknowledge also my
