imaginary legal cases: see note on 7, 168. privatus: ‘retire from
office and . . . ' 'l'his earlier republican use of the word does not occur
again in Juvenal, who employs it elsewhere, as is usual during the
empire, with reference to private citizens or subjects as distinguished from
the emperor and his family; cs. 4, 66; 6, 114; 12, 1073 13, 41. altum:
for the case, see ἓ 81 and G.-L. ἐ 333.

18. vatibus: Tac Dial. 9 eyreyium poetam vel, si hoc honomflcentius ·
eat, praeclarissimum vatem. This old word for ‘ speaker,’ ⁴ poet' was
supplanted as early as Ennius by the Greek poeta, which was then
the more honorable term. With Vergil and Horace, however, vates
came to mean something more than a mere poet, an inspired bard.
Here, asin Lucr. 1, 102, 109, it.is used ironically.¹ periturae: Mart.
11, 1, 4 brevior quod mihi charta perit. In this sense ‘be wasted,' perire
is common in Juvenal. On the use of the future participle, see g 118, c.

19. decurrere: ‘run through the course ’3 for the metaphor (5127), cf.
Cic. Cat. Ji. 83 nec. . .velim quasi decurso spatio ad carceres a calce

Lucilius.² For Lucilius’ relation to the development of satire, see ἓ 4.

22-50. The eunuch with a wife, the noble lady in the arena, the

write satire.

22. tener: a scornful epithet when applied to men ς 6, 383 ; 8, 16; 12,
393 Catuli. 63, 88 tenerumque vidit Attin. Mevia: apparently a
woman 01 rank who entered the arena in the dress os an Amazon (nuda

‚mamma) for the contest with wild beasts (venatio); cf. Tac. Ann. xv, -.

32 feminarum inlustrium senatorumque plures per arenam foedati sunt.
The name occurs again in 2, 49; see ¹524.

23. figatz i.e. confiyat,· on this use, see ¹544. venabula: perhaps
plural for singular (ἓ 48) ; but cf. Verg. Aen. 1, 313.

24. patricios: metrically convenient sor the wider term nobile& cs. 4,
102; 8, 1903 10, 332. The scansion patriciae, which admits the word

Suae. v1‚ 26, 6 patriciumque nefas ; he was followed by Lucan,
PersiuS, Statius Juvenal, and Martial.⁸ provocet: in this sense
