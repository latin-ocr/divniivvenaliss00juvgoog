SATIRE 1 2 1

’ 151. materian on hiatus in Juvenal, 866 ἓ 156.

158. simplicitas: 2, 18; Liv. XL, 47, 3 veniunt leyati ex oppido, quorum
sermo antiquae simplicitatis fuit, non dissimulantium bellaturos.

154. Mucius: P. Mucius Scaevola, consul in 133 B.C., who was
attacked by Lucilius (ᾗ 4); ci. PerS. 1, 114 f. secuit Lucilius urbem, te
Lupe, te Muci. Juvenal has in mind the ireedom oi speech practised
by Lucilius and hence introduces Mucius as a type 01 1116 influential per·
sons whose vices he may expose.

155. pense ‘ paint,’ ‘ portray,' regularly used ot the artist, e.g. Ovid,
A. A. 111, 401 si Venerem Cous nusquam posuisset Apelles‚· 0116 might
expect proponere in this sense, but the simple verb was the technical·
word (ἓ 44). 011 the use of an imperative as protasiS, see ἓ 107. Sopho-
nius Tigellinus was a powerful favorite of Ner0, notorious sorhis wan-
tonness and cruelty. He was compelled by Otho to put an end to his
own lise (69 161.). lucebis: Plaut. Capt. 596 s. te . . . pixc atra aqi-
cet apud carnuficem tuoque capiti inluceat. This refers to the twnica
, molesta, to which the modern coat of tar and seathers is most nearly an

equivalent. The Romans, however, set fite to the inflammable materials
with which the victim was covered. See note on 8, 235.

157. sulcum deducis = as your body is dragged off with the hook (uncus) ι;
see note on 10, 66, and sor the change of tense, ἓ 136, b. In this passage
Juvenal seems to be confounding two different modes of violent death,
burning at the stake (fimo pectore) and slaughter in the amphitheatre.

159. plumis3 10, 362 and Mart. xn, 17, 8 dormit et in pluma purpureo-
que toro ,· the soitness 01 the lectica (note on 1, 120) is emphasized by the
use os this word. On the rhythm, 866 p. lxix.

160. 611111 veniet} see ἓ 109. labellum: on the 101111, 866 g 41, 1, d.

161. qui: the antecedent is ei understood3 an exact parallel is Cic.
Dom. 20, 51 poena est (sc. ei) qui receperit.² hic est: Pers, 1, 281161-
chrum est diyito monstrari et dicier “ hic est,” which Juvenal probably
remembered. This use 01 hic est, which is found also in Martial, v,

has the future indicative with forsitan (forsan) in 12, 125 and 14, 295, but not in the
second person. See Beer, Spica. Iuv„ p. 60, and ς 71, b.

¹ This interpretation, which goes back to the scholiast, has been considered open to
objection on account 01 1116 sudden change 01 161186. S. G. Owen, class. Rev„ xx, 1897,
pp. «tou-1, adopting Maguire's suggestion (Hermam, xv, 1883, pp. 422 1.) that sulcum refers
to light as in Verg. Aen. 11, 697 and other places, retains deducit with P and several
Mss. 01 1116 ω class, and supplies quae,1.e. taeda, as the subject, comparing 14, 1053 15, 170
and Mum-0, Lucr. v1, 52. J. D. Duff, however, sees ln this passage another form 01 1116
proverb 101· fruitless toil round in 7, 48 1., 101· which see note there.

¹ This seems more to the point as well 66111 closer harmony with LatIn idiom than to
take the subject 01 erit as the 6111666116111 01 qui. See Nagelsbach, Lat. stu.⁸, p. 961.
