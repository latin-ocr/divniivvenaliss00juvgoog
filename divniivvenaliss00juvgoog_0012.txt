2. Roman claim to originality. Every other class of ’
Latin poetry is known by a Greek title3 satire alone has a
name distinctly Roman, and is based on no corresponding
Greek type. For this reason the, claim to originality² set
up by Horace and Quintilian must, with some modification,
be regarded as valid. When 'we say that satire is a genuine
creation of the‘ Roman· geniuS, we do not mean that there
are no satiric elements in Greek 3 for, from the beginning,
Greek literature abounds in such elements. Nor do we
· mean to say that satire, unlike all other Latin poetry, was
not largely influenced by Greek thought and Greek methods
of expression3 on the contrary, such influence was wide-
spread, and was acknowledged by the Romans 'themselves'
But the Romans first recognized satire as a distinct literary
type, saw its possibilities, and gave it development, and in
this sense they were the creators of a new department.

3. Early satura. Ennius. Varro. The earliest form
in which the satura existed at Rome cannot with certainty
be determined. According to Livy⁴ the term was used to

which the old Italian verses of banter and ridicule, the so-
called versus Fescennini, were combined with the dancing,

music, and stage action learned from Etruscan actors
brought to Rome in 364 B.c. ⁸ Whether this be true or not,
