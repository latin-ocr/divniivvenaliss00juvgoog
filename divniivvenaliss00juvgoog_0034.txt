xxviii Inrsonuc‘non

from Bobbio, now number 57 50 in the Vatican Library.¹ It is
written in capitals and contains one hundred and four verses
from Juvenal and Persius, This Ms., in the important passage

15, 27, agrees with P in giving the consul’s name as Iunco.

31. A florilegium of St. Gall‚' number 870, contains
selections from Juvenal to the extent of two hundred and

eighty-two verseS, and is in general agreement with P. By
the aid of this ΜΒ. and os the scholion on 8, 157, Buecheler
restored the true reading mulio consul in 8, 148.³

32. Inferior MSS. All other MSS. of Juvenal, too numer·
ous to be mentioned here in detail, form what may be called
' the inferior or interpolated class (ω), of which none is earlier
than the ninth century, and almost all are later.⁴ These
Mss., differing more or less widely one from another, offer a
text decidedly inferior to that of P, though in agreement
with P sufficiently often to render any clear-cut distinction

from the better MS. impossible.⁶ In the codex Laurentianusr, ”

xxxlv, 42, of the eleventh century, at the end os the first
book, and in the codex LeidensiS, 82, of the same century, at
the end of 'the second book, we find the notice Leyi eqo Ni-
caeus apud M. Servium Romae et emendavi.⁸· If this Servius
is the well-known grammarian and author of the commentary

on Vergil, the recension of his pupil Nicaeus must be placed
about the end of the fourth century.⁷ ΑΙ] the MSS. of the
inferior class go back to this N icaean recension 3 PA alone,
