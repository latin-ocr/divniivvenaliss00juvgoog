causidicus. κ

129. mamphula: sc. statuae. As a partos the ornamentation os the
forum oi Augustus statues with honorary inscriptions (tituli ,· see note on
5, 34) ⁸ were erected to famous men, especially to generals who had cele-
brated triumphs (Suet, Any. 31). Augustus was very careful to admit
to this honor only the most worthy, but some of his successorS, notably
Nero and Domitian, disregarded the earlier restrictions and granted

that he was the first to proclaim Vespasian emperor and that he was in

presence of his statue in the forum of, Augustus. Arabarches (“Ἀραψ- ,
ἄρχειν) in two Greek inscriptions is the technical title for a high official

132. veteres: ‘of long standing‚' as in 3, 1; 5, 64 3' 6, 846, ete. For κ
contrast with antiquus, ‘of ancient date,' cs. 6, 21, and 15, 33; as a ,
substitute for antiquus, see note on 14,' 189. ,

133. longissima: Stat. Theb. 11, 321 spes, ubi lonqa venit, (animum ¹¹
