SATIRE Ι 1 1

64. quadrivio: indignation so overpowers him that he would write at
once, even amid the noise and confusion of the street. iam: ‘ no
less than'; the number is increasing. sexta cervice: = sea: eer-
vicibus (cf. 6, 351) ; thus Plin. N. H. ΧΠ, 9 epulatum se curn duode-
vicensimo comite, and Stat. Silo. 1v, 1, 9 bis sextus hono-8. The singular
cervix is not found in prose before Livy; Cicero has only the plural
even when one person is meant, e. g. Phil. XI, 2, 5 post cervicibus fractis
cap-ut abscidit. The common use of the singular in the Silver Age is
doubtless due to the influence of poetry and the sermo v‘etharia¹

65. hino atque inde: cf. 8, 195 ; 14, 12 f. cathedra: cf. 6, 91; 9, 52.

66. referens: Plin. Ep. IV, 2, 1 si patrem non referret. For the con-
struction, 511οἓ97, d. ’ Maecenate: 12, 39 Maecenatibus. The name
had long been a proverb for luxurious effeminaey (ef. Sen. Ep. 120, 19,
quoted in note on 1. 24), but not for pride and vulgar ostentation.

67. signator falsi: the forgery of wius, a crime of frequent occurrence
in Rome, is referred to again in 8, 142.π The person in question, possi-
bly one of the original witnesseS, apparently writes a new will, counter-
feiting the signatures and seal (hence siqnator), and substitutes it for
the genuine document. Compare the similar crime in Cic. Clu. 41 testa-
mentum in alias tabulas transcriptum· siquis adulterinis obsiyna2·it.

68. tabulis: see note 011 l. 63; with exiquis of. breviter in 12, 125.
gemma: cf. Mart. X, 70, 7, quoted in note on 8, 143.

69. matrona potens: Hor. A. P. 116 matrona potens an sedula. nutriat.
Calenum: the wine of Cales (now Calvi) in Campania is mentioned by
Horace (0. 1, 20, 9; 31, 9; IV, 12, 14) and by Pliny, N. H. x1v‚ 65.

70. rubetam: cf. 6, 659. The belief that poison was made from the
, 1111185 01· blood of the toad⁴ is repeatedly referred to by the elder Pliny!

71. rudes melior: observe the effect of the juxtaposition of contrasted
words; cf. 3, 207 ; 7, 28. ’ Lucusta: afamous professional poisoner from
Gaul (so schol.)‚ who was employed by Agrippina and Nero, She was
put to death by the order of Gralba.4 propinquas: see §54

72. famam et populum: ‘the gossiping throng’; on hendiadys, see
(31,-L. §698 nigros : Servius, Aen. IV, 514 niqri fiunt homines post
venenum. efferre: regularly used of funerals; cf. 6, 567; 14, 220.

¹ Cervtae is discussed from this point of view by P. Maas, A.L.L. ΧΠ, 1902, pp. 501 f.

2 Penalties were provided by the Lem Cornelia de Falsis (Dio. xnvm, 10). ,

³ See J ahn's index s. vv. rubeta, rana. There is some doubt whether the original read·
ing of P was rubeta (1.0. rubetam) or rubeta (abl.) ; in the latter case take ciro as dative
wit-h porrectura, and sitiente rubeta together. Sittente would then have causative force,

‘causing thirst,' ‘inflaming,' as in ovid, A..4. 11, 231. See H. Polstorff, In luvenalis
satirae observationes criticae, Prog. Gustrow‚ 1896, p. 3.
