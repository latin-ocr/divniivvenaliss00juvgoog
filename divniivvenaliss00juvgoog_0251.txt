(a person of low origin), because the ,qiyantcs were sons of earth; cs.
Pers, 6, 59 s. But this does not explain fraterculus and the contrast
between the diminutive and qiyas. Juvenal wished to emphasize the
perilous position ot the noble, which is even more perilous than that of
the giant’s little brother. Friedl. sees in this an allusion to somevtale
in which a giant abused his little brother.¹

aroused in the breast of the tyrant.

12, 41 intonsis Curium capillis. In the time ot Cicer0, and probably in
that of Juvenal as well, men usually wore beards until they were about
forty years of age ; cf. 6, 105, 215.

104. molior vultu: ct. 1. 75 pallor, 1. 97, and 9, 12 vultus yravis.

, , ‘corpse8,' as in 10, 259; cf. 1, 146 ; 10, 241. This poetic use is seen also

in Vergil, Horace, Propertius, and Valerius Flaccus.

named Porphyrio, whom Martiah xm, 78, calle qiqas.

Domitian (gloss p). ⁸ On the use ot venter and abdomen, see A.1..L. 1v, p. 108.
