THE ADVANTAGES ΟΕ· MILITARY 1⁴18·ss

Countless advantages belong to the soldier who is attended by good
fortune (11. 1-6). Π a civilian is assaulted by a soldier, he dare not
prosecute before the centurion3 for all the soldiers are hostile and
civilian witnesses are afraid to appear (ll. 7-34). Instead os the tedious
delays of civil courts‚ the soldier can have an immediate settlement os
his disputes (u. 35-50), and he is the only man who can control his pos-
sessions while his father lives (ll. 51-60).

The genuineness os this fragment has often been ‹lenied from the ζ

times os the scholiast to our own. But it is quoted as genuine by Servius
and Priscian, and in both style and content is not unworthy ot Juvenal.
