2 ’ COMMENTARY

to read his own works in public.¹ In the absence os newspaper, review,
or printed book, the importance ot the custom to men of letters is obvious„
In the time os Juvenal these recitations were so numerous and for the
most part so uninteresting that men who valued their time rebelled:
hence the complaint os Mart. x, 70, 10 Auditur tota saepe poeta die.
cf. 3, 9; 7, 39 ff. auditor: sc. ero,· for the ellipsiS‚ see 5138, a.
Plin. Ep. 1, 13, 6 scribere aliquid quod uon recitem, ne videar,
quorum recitationibus adfui, non auditor fuisse sed creditor.
numquamne: the addition os -ue to negative words suggests the affirma-
tive; not only nonne, but also nemone, nullusne, etc. Compare 6, 1613
13, 174. reponam: like ‘requite,' of returning evil sor evil, e.g.
Sen. Dial. IV, 28, 5 iniuriam, and, without direct object, Cic. Att. xnr,
12, 3 Catulo et Ducullo alibi reponemus. Horace had expressed the
same antithesis in a slightly different way in Epist. 1, 19, 39 nobilium
scriptorum auditor et ultor.

2. totiens: recitations lasting more than one day are mentioned by
Pliny, Ep. 111, 18, 4; 1v, 27, 13 vm, 21, 4. Here, however, the Theseis

 

(cf. Aeneis, Achilleis) is merely a type of the tedious mythological epic ¹

such as Juvenal refers to again (l. 53) and Martial osten rails at (IV, 49 ;
vm, 3; 1x, 5o; X, 4, etc.). Cordi: the name occurs in Martial and
Tacitus, but 110 identification is possible. rauci: from the effects of
long reading 3 cf. 6, 515 rauca cohors and 8, 59 rauco. . .circo.

3. inpune: emphatic position. For a similar change of ictus (inpune—

inpune), cf. 3, 53. erge: cs. ἑνρῡ 3, 281and erqo 9, 823 see §152 ι

recitaverit: indicates the future result of a past action, as e.g. Verg.
Aen. lx, 784 f. tauta-3 strayes impune per urbem ediderit θ’ togatas:
sc. fabula-3, comedies in which scene and costume were Roman as con—

trasted with palliatae in which they were Greek. The chief writer ¹

of toyatae was L. Afranius (about 125 Β. 0.,) whose Incendium was
performed as late as the time os Nero.⁸

4. elegos. strictly poems in the elegiac distich, devoted chiefly to the
passion of love 111 its mournful aspects; cf. Hor. 0. 1, 33, 2 miserabiles

decantes eleqos, addressed to Tibullus. Juvenal seems to sweep over ’

almost the entire field of poetry in these opening verseS. diem cen-
eumpeerit: Seneca, Ep. 122, 11 toto die recitasse ,· Martial quoted on
1. 1. ingens: refers to the size os the volumen or roll; cf. Mart.
x1v, 190 Livius inqena

¹ Seneca, Cfmtr. tv, praef. §2 Pollio Asinius. ..primus enim omnium Romanorum
advocatis hominibus scripta sua recitavit. ² Madvig, opusc. Aeaci.. 11, p. 87.

⁸ Suet. Ner. 11 ; Quintil. x, 1, 100. 'Phe extant fragments of the toqatae may be con·
sulted best in Ribbeck, Scaea. Poenis Fraq„ n⁸‚ 157-266.
