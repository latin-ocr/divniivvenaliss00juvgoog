88. mam eluviem: the cleaning of the sewers (schol.). Convicts·
were usually employed for this purpose (Trajan to Pliny, Ep. 32, 2) and γ
the contractors who had charge of the work were held in slight esteem.
othere, however, refer to the inundations of the 'l'iber and to the neces.
sity of clearing away the filth left by the receding waterS. portan-
dum: the office of the undertaker (libitinariua) likewise was despised.

88. snb hasta: suggesting military conquest and therefore ownership
(domina). The verse refers to the despised but lucrative calling of the
praeeo, one of whose functione was to sell slaves z cf. 1. 157 and 7, 6.¹

84. cornicines: men who formerly were the musicians of a travelling
show have now reached such wealth and oprominence that they furnish
gladiatorial exhibitionS.

86. nomque por oppida: Mart. 111, 95, 7 notumque per oppida nomen.
buono: of a mouthing orator in 11, 343 see g 43.

86. verno pollice: pollicem vertere (convertere ,· see ἓ 44) indicates the
gesture by which the spectators ordered the death of a conquered gladi-
ator, pollicem premere the one by which they demanded that his lise be
spared: cf. Plin. N. H. xxvm, 25 and Hor. Epist. 1, 18, 66. The exact
nature of these gestures is uncertain.' ·

88. loricas: public conveniences similar to those seen in Europe now·
The upstart, ready for anything (omnia), leases these and makes them a
source os revenue. The emperor Vespasian was blamed by his son Titus
for doing the same thing (Suet. 23›.³ eum sint: sc. tale3.⁴

40. voluit Fortuna iocari: for the thought, cf. 6, 608; 7, 197.

Martial‚ see ἓ 26. mentiri nescio: Petron. 116 sin. . ..sustinetis sem-
per mentiri, recta ad lucrum curritis-,⁶

48. antrorum: astrologers were much consulted by the higher classes

² The interpretation of Schoemann (Neue Jahrb., xcnt, pp. 765 11), who saw here a
reference to fraudulent bankruptcy, has little support.

² An ancient relies, now in the Museum at Nlmes, has been said to indicate that pol-
licem premere means‘to turn the thumb up ' ; pollicem vertere would then signify ‘to
turn the thumb down' (Friedl., Sittenqeeelz„ 11⁸, p. 387, Ν. 4). This, however, is denied
by Edwin Post (Am. Jour. Phil., xm, 1892. pp. 213-25), who reproduces a photograph
of the relies in question and believes that, while pollicem vertere is ‘to turn the thumb
down,' pollicem premere is merely ‘ to prees or cover the thumb ⁹ with the fingere. For
another view, 888 Mayor's note.

sint, at the end of a verse.
