intolerabilius nihil est quam femina diveS.
si natura negat, facit indignatio versum.¹

Juvenal, indeed, never appears to such good advantage as
when taken in quotations, and no other Latin author has
produced so many expressions which are still in common use.²

FORMS ΛΝΒ VOCABULARY ⁸

38. case endings. In the genitive singular of ·io-stems
both the earlier form in -i and the later form in -ii are
found: ey. 10, 123 Antoni ,· 4, 31 Palati, but 8, 102 Par-
rhasii ,· 3, 125 servitii. Propertius was the first poet to make
much use of the form in --ii, which was avoided entirely by
Manilius, Seneca (Trag.), PersiuS, and Martia] (except in one
Greek word, cybii).⁴

39. The ablative singular of the comparative ends in -i in
'the following instances ε 13, 48 minori ,· 7, 77 leviori. This
form is exceedingly rare in classica] prose and not common
in poetry, but it is attested. for Juvenal by Priscian (G.L.K.
11, p. 346).⁶

40. In one instance the nominative plural of a present
participle ends in -is .· 14, 300 velantis inquinet panni.⁶

41. DiminutiveS. A fondness for diminutives is charac-
teristic of the sermo cotidianae, and ie, therefore, a promi-
nent feature of satire. In Juvenal, diminutives are used in
a number of different wayS, as follows :

Ι. Substantives. a. With real diminutive force ε aq. 3,
102 iyniculum ; 3, 226 hortulus ,· 6, 57 ayeZZO.

¹ 14, 139 ς 2, 83 ; 7, 145 ς 6, 46ος 1, 79. Α large collection of such apothegms may be
round in J. Streiflnger, Der sm des Satirikere Juvenum, Regensburg, 1892, pp. 43-8.

⁸ For example, take ιο, 856 mens sana in corpore sano ‚· 3, 165 res anmoeta donn& 6,
223 hoc volo, sic iubam· 7, 154 crambe repetam· 1, 7⁴9: 2, 833 3, 152f. ς Ἰ5, 130 f.; 6,
1663 14, 47.

⁸ ‘Po facilitate reference, the most striking features of Juvenal's style are set down ln
a more detailed and systematic rushion. Attention is called not only to the special
peculim-{ties of the catii-es, but also to dlvergences from the classical norm and to
characteristics of the Silver Age. ⁴ Neue, Formenlehre, ι’, pp. 134—54.
