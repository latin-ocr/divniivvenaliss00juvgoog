highest practical wisdom, which forbids revenge, enables ἰ
men to rid themselves of faults and errors, and points out l
to them the right.¹ Her teachingS, which are always in l
harmony with those of nature,' enjoin submission to for-

was naturally more inclined to the theories of Stoicism than
to those of any other school. His belief in fate⁴ as an in-

the same source are derived his views on the interest of the
gods in human affairs, on the wise man's freedom from anger
and desire, and on the importance of courage in the face of
trouble and death.⁷

crime,¹² and says that man is differentiated from the brutes
by his capacity to worship and to apprehend the divine.²⁸

that the true seat of guilt lies not in the act but in the in· 1
tention and motive.²⁴ On the other hand, Juvenal has no

sympathy with literal interpretatione of the tales of Greek l
