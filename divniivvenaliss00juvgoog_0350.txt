nmmum 011· ΤΗΕ EGYP'HANS

This satire is little more than an invective aimed at the despised Egyp-
110110, for whom Juvenal has already expressed his utter contempt (ἓ 19).
Α11 instance 01 cannibalism‚ arising out 01 0 religione 101111, is reported
00 0 recent occurrence 01111 described in minute detail, though, 101·
reasons suggested in the note on 1. 33, it seems possible that the whole
story is 0 111010 invention. Nor is it necessary to conclude 110111 1. 45
11101 1110 author had ever been in Egypt ς 110 11011 certainly never visited
the region in which this scene is laid (ἓ 15). Like others 01 1110 later
satires the fifteenth is matred by absurd exaggeration and tedicus
repetition3 the strongest passage is that which treats 01 sympathy as the
noblest attribute 01 111011 (ll. 131 ff.).
