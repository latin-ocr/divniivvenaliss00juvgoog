79. Necdum occurs in the sense of simple nondum: 1, 6
scriptus et in teryo necdum finitus Orestes, Clear cases of
this change occur in Livy and Tacitus and later become very ξ
numerous. Nec -·-· non, however, is found in early Latin,
ey. Plaut. Most. 240 nec reete)

80. Instead of the correlative use of nec we find nec. . . ,
aut (8, 217 f.; 14, 173 f.), nee. . mec. . . (13, 43 f.), and
nec.. . -que . ,aut (15, 124 f.). Such irregularities are not
rare in poetry.²

 

 

The cases ⁸

81. Accusative. The accusative of the inner object is
common in Juvenal: ay. 1, 16 f. ut altum dormiret ;'2, 3
Bacchanalia vivunt ,· 14, 295 aestivum tonat.¹

82. Audere is found with the accusative nine times in
J uvena13 2, 2 aliquid de moribus audent ; 10, 174 f. quidquid
Graecia mendax audet in historia ; 2, 823 6, 973 8, 1653 15,
122. It is doubtful whether the Romans felt the omission
of an infinitive in such cases·

83. Dative. a. After similis and dissimilis Juvenal em-
ploys the dative, except 10, 192 dissimilemque sui: eq. 2, 33 3
3, 183 5, 1323 6, 7, 1653 15, 68. The genitive was the con· Ῑ
'struction in early Latin and was more common for persons
even in the classica] period. 1

b. Certain adjectives which are usually followed by prep- ἵ
ositional phrases are found in Juvenal only with the dative, Ὺ
often of the gerundive construction: ey. (1) aptus: 7, 58 f.
aptusque bibendis fontibus ,⁰ 6, 5813 15, 145 3 (2) utilis:
14, 71 f. utilis ayris, utilis. . ‚rebus ayendis ; 10, 3483 but
oftener of persons, ay. 6, 210, 2403 7, 96 3 9, 273 (3) diver-
sas .· 10, 3 vera bona atque illis multum diversa ,· (4) maturus: ·-
