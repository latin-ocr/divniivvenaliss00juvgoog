The style of Juvenal

36. The work of few poets presente at the same time such
high excellence -and such glaring imperfectiori as that of
Juvenal.' His extraordinary gift for the lifelike presentation
of details was reinforced and displayed to the best advantage
bya style whose rhetorical brilliance was due partly to his
own nature and training and partly to the tendencies os his
time. No one who has read the first satire, for example, can
ever forget the picture of Crispinus with his Tyrian cloak and
massive ring, os the young sport showing off his fast horses
to his sweetheart on the Flaminian Way, or of the distribu-
tion οἱ the dole in the early morning to a motley crowd.¹
But this command of details and mastery of brilliant phrase
is counterbalanced by an almost complete lack of the sense of
proportion and an utter.disregard for harmonicus structure.²
The third satire is perhaps the only one which is not open to
objection from this point of vieW. None of these poemS, then,
has held its place in the world’s literature because of its liter-
ary form as a whole, but rather because os the excellent descrip-
tion and portraiture and the skilful presentation of details.

37. One of the results of Juvenal’s rhetorical training was
his extensive use of sententiae. Many verses and brief pas-
sages which are of the most striking character contain state-
ments of such general application that they may be separated
from the context without losing their force.' One might
quote, for example, the following:

crescit amor nummi, quantum ipsa pecunia crevit.
nemo repente fuit turpissimus.
rara in tenui facundia panno

⁸ Α considerable number ot such verses, which do not seem to be required by the

, context, were once regarded by some critice as notes introduced from the margin ς now,
’ however, they are accepted by all as genuine.
