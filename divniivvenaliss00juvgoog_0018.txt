interval.¹ The available evidence for fixing the date of the
second book (Sat. 6) consists of the reference to earthquakes
and fioods in the far East and to a comet which portended
disaster to the Armenian and Parthian kings⁹ On the
basis of the records of Chinese astronomers, Friedliinder⁸
argues with great probability that the comet referred to is
one which was visible at Rome in November of the year 115,
for the campaign of Trajan against the Parthians was under-
taken in the next-year.⁴ In December, 115, also, the city of
Antioch suffered severely from earthquake. If these are
really the phenomena to which Juvenal referS, it is perfectly
clear that the second book (Sat. 6) was published in the year 116
or soon after.⁶ The third book (Sat. 7-9) is introduced by the
statement that the prospects of intellectual pursuits depend
on the favor of the emperor. N othwithstanding much dis-
cussion and argument to the contrary, there is no reason to
doubt that the reference is to Hadrian, whose accession took
place in 117.ο After this date, then, but before the year
121, when Hadrian left Rome for an extensive tour of the
provinces, the third book was published, probably in 119 01·
120. The fifth book (Sat. 13-16) contains two distinct
chronological references⁷ by which the date of its publica-
