SATIRE XII

A mvtuaocs m

In this entire Juvenal must be found guilty on charges os weakneoe,
ambiguity‚ and obscurity, especially in the description of the storm (ll.
18-82). Some have objected to his inconsisteney in bringing together
subjeets so dissimilar as thanksgiving ior a friend's escape from ship-
vreek (ll. 1-92) and a bitter attaek on lem-hunters (ll. 93-130), and
the objection is not without soree. Stin, thaee subjecte are not entirely
uneonnected. The satirist expresses genuine joy at the sate return of
Catullus and then defends himself from the imputation of sinister
motivoe. When once captatio is mentioned, his tendeney to digress
carries him into the subject, · see 5 141 and notes on ll. 82 and 104.
