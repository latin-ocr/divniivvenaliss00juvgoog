serious temperament,² good education, and high character,
inspired by a genuine, though narrow patriotism, filled with
an earnest admiration for the simple manners of the past,' ’
and therefore with an intense hatred for the degeneracy of
the present, swayed by a moral indignation ⁸ which is per-
fectly genuine, though at times grossly exaggerated,-—-in
short, not a genius of the highest order, but a man endowed
with unusual gifts of both mind and heart.

Juvenal the Satirist

preface to the first book, Juvenal lays before the reader his
programme aud gives some indicatione of his method and
point of view. Living in the midst of such degeneracy and cor-
ruption, he says that it is difficult for him not to write satire.⁴ ¹
Never was vice so prevalent, ‚extravagance so general :⁸
never did the possession of wealth so quickly elevate the
most degraded to the highest honor.⁶ Still, it is dangerous ι

Are we 10 understand from this that he intended to satirize Ι
1110 persons and morals of the present, under the pretence of
attacking those of the past Ρ When the first satire was pub-

in some respects at least, could not possibly have been so bad
as Juvenal depicts.¹⁰ At the same time it must be admitted
that in any great capital, even under the most favorable Ι
circumstances, there is abundant material to occupy the pen ’

² There is in Juvenal scarcely anything that can be called humor: of humorous
situations there is no lack (e. ρ. 1, 123 ff.), but they are usually presented in such a way as
to arouse indignation rather than ridicule. Cf„ however, J. Jessen‚ Wltz und Humor
