2⁶. gravis: probably predicative, = yraviter, ⁴ sounded grandly.'¹
See note on 4, 103 for the treatment 01 1119 heard 3 cf. Verg. Ecl. 1, 28
candidior postquam tondenti barba cadebat. The verse is repeated in
10, 226; so 10, 365 = 14, 315 and 13, 137 almost = 16, 41. See §142 and
p. 1111, n. 3.

2⁷. revocantet as it it were about to sall off. The lacerna is here a
substitute sor the tegla, though ordinarily it was an additional outside

by musicians (10, 212).²

28. ventilet: Apul. Met. 11, 26 et in aureos refulgentes, quos identidem
manu mea ventilabam attonitus. By waving his hand or removing the
ring from the finger he causes the air to circulate and incidentally dis-
plays the ornament. aestivum: i.e. in summer; cf. Mart. 1, 12, 5 hic
mdis aestivae praestabat porticus umbras. See ,ξ 55. Friedl. under-
stands aestivum auriam as ⁴ summer ring '; but cs. George Eliot‚ Daniel
Deronda, chap. 68 (taking off a heavy ring in warm weather): ‘I un-
derstand why the Romans had summer rings-—if they had them.’ Ju-
venal simply says that in summer, when fingers swcat, Crispinus airs
his ring, which is as heavy as he can bear.⁸ Mart. xr, 37 speaks of a
ring which weighed a pound and was more suited. to the ankle than
to the finger. aurum: here and. in 7, 89=a ring, in 6, 589: a

¹ Juvenal may here have reference to 911 official unitorm, perhaps that or the praefectus
praetorio. In the meeting of the imperial council described in the fourth satire the only
0119 present who is not a senator, besides the praefectus praetorio, Fuscus, is Crispinus:
cf. 4, 32 princeps equitum and Mart. vm, 48. This is the opinion 01 Borghesi, Oeuvree, v,
pp. 514-6, and of A. Gercke, Gett. gel. Anz. 1896. pp. 975 f. 3 for the contrary view or
Hirschfeld and Friedl„ 999 references given by Stein in Pauly-wisa, 1v, 1720.

⁸ This interpretation, advocated by Gercke (1. l.) and Duff, is supported by the echo in
Dracontius, Laud. Dei, 111, 56 qui colet aestivum membris cudantibm ostrum poscere.
