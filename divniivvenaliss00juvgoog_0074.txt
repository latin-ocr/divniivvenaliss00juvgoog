lxviii ' mrssonuo'non

Other eadenees are exceptional. They involve some conflict,
and they are largely oonfined to the early poets and satire.

Of these exceptional eadenees the most endurable is repre-
sented by “

ΠΙ. Nota magis nulli domus'est sua 1 quam mihi 1110115.

The rule of the monosyllable here—which softens the eon·
fljet as much as possible—is never broken by Martial, and by
Juvenal only in 3, 135 and 7, 160 (of., however, 10, 140).

IV. Dormiret‚ stulta est elementia Ι 011111 tot ubique

is very rare. The only cases in Juvenal are 1, 17, 30 ; 3, 54 ; ¹

13, 65.

To end the hexameter with a monosyllable was always bad. .²
It involved confliot, as do all other exceptional eadences, and

was not sonorous. But if the monosyllable was preceded by

another monosyllable, the oadenee was endurable, though ,
always exceptional. The most frequent, therefore, of the ζ

monosyllabis cadenoes are :

V. Et nos ergo manum ferulae subduximus et 1105,

(rarest in the second satire, most frequent in the eighth) and
its sub-varieties (of whioh Juvenal furnishes an occasional
example) ε
Argillam atque rotam eitius properate, sed ex 1100 ’
and
Quantum grammaticus meruit labor ? et tamen ex hoo.

The habitat of v and its sub-varieties is Horace (about 5 56), ·

Juvenal (3ὲ ᾖ), Persius (3 ᾖ), and Lucretius (13 ᾧ).
Other lines ending with a monosyllable are represented by
the following types ε

VI. Tam patiens urbiS, tam ferreuS, ut teneat se,
VII. Quid tamen exspectant, Phrygio quos tempus erat iam,
VIII. Conductas Corvinus oveS, ego possideo plus.
