codem Montepessulanm, because it is now in the library of the
Medical School at Montpellier (number 125).ι This MS„
written in the· early part of the ninth century, contains
Persius as well as Juvenal, and is furnished with both scholia
and glosses.' Corrections were made and variant readings
added by several different hands from the ninth to the
eleventh century3 all these are indicated by the letter p. It
is probable that P once contained the whole of the last
satire 3 for 16, 60 is the last line of the tenth and what is now
‘the last quire, and, according to F. Buecheler, no one who
has handled the Ms. can doubt that it has been mutilated.'
The surpassing authority of P, which was first shown in
Jahn’s edition of 1851, rests on the fact that in many pas-
sages it alone has preserved the correct reading and that,
apart from the changes introduced by p, it is tolerably free
from corruptions. It contains, moreover, the best selection
from the ancient commentarieS.⁴

29. Aarau fragments. Five leaves of a Ms. which in
external appearance closely resembled P were discovered
about twenty-five years ago by J. Wirz ⁶ at AaraU, Switzer-
land, in the bindings 'of old books. These fragments not
only represent the same recension of the text, but they are
like P in containing twenty-nine lines to the page, and even
in having the same passages as the corresponding pages of the
complete MS.

30. Bobbio palimpsest. Another fragment which may
be mentioned here consists of two leaves of a palimpsest
