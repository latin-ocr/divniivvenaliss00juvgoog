a. Collectively: e. 9. 3, 285 aenea lampas,· 7, 46 conducto
aymo,- 7,132 lonyo assere.

b. With an adjective that implies plurality: e. 9. 1, 120 f.
densissima leetiea; 8, 7 multa virya; 8, 58 plurima palma.

50. The use of one or more proper names in singular or
plural to designate a class is common in Juvenal: ey. 1,
108 f. eqo possideo plus Pallante et Licinis ,· 2, 40 tertius e eaelo
cecidit Cato ; 12, 39 teneris Maecenatiba8.¹

51. Juvenal is very fond os using personal names from
mythology as appellatives ε ey. 1, 61 Automedon (= driver) ;
4, 65 Atride-s· (= emperor) 3 16, 26 Pylades (= friend).²

52. Instead os a substantive with an attributive adjective
or a genitive of quality, the substantive is sometimes in the
genitive dependent on another substantive, which really con· Α
veys in a more emphatic way the meaning of the adjective or ¹
genitive of quality: ay. 1, 10 aarum pelliculae (= auream-⁴
pelliculam); 4, 39 spatium admirabile rhombi (= rhombus
spatii admirabilis) ; 10, ’75 f. secura senecta-s· principi-3.

53. For certain forms of filias which are unsuitable to the ¹
metro, the corresponding forms of iuven-is are used: eq.
3, 158 iuvenesque lanistae ,· 4, 95 3 8, 2623 10, 310 ; 14, 23.

The Adjectnve

54. As substantive. The substantive use of the adjec
tive 1s very free 1n Juvenal, and in many cases a second ad-
jective is added to modify the first: e.9.1,149 in praecipiti ἶ
vitium stetit,·10,107 inpulsae praeceps inmane ruinae; 1, ¹
71. rades propinqua& 6, 548 divitis orbi;14,178 prope-
rantis avari.²³ 2

55. As adverb. Adjectives, especially those which desig
nate time, are often used where the sense would require an
adverb or an adverbial phrase : α.9. 1, 28 ventilet aestivum
