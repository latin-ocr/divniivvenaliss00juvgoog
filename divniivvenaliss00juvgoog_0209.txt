SATI RE 1 9

says iraque nostra fruitur. provincia plum: some of the wrongs
suffered by the provinciale are set forth in 8, 87 ff. See §g 132 and 47, a.

51-80. In the presence oi domestic dishonor‚ youthful profligacy,
forgery, and murder, ought I to waste my time on epies? Men praise
virtue, and give themselves up to dishonesty and lust. Genius or no
genius», 1 must attempt to write.

51. haee ego: see ἓ 133. Venusina digna lucerna: ‘worthy the
midnight oil of a Horace’; cf. Hor. Epist. 11, 1, 112 f. prius orto sole
viyil calamum et chartae et serinia posce. Horace was born at Venusia.

52. magis: i.e. potius, as in Lucr. 11, 97; Ovid, Triet. V, 2, 6; see
g 68. Heracleas: sc. fabulae. This and the two following verses
refer to favorite subjects sor epic. On spondaic verse& see g 152.

53. Diomedeas τ os the son of Tydeus (so schol.), not os the owner of the
fiesh-eating mares, who was killed by Herakles3 cf. Verg. Aen. 1, 752
with Servius’ note.¹ mugitum labyrinthi: the struggle of Theseus
and the Minotaur ; cf. 1. 2 Theseide.

54. puero: i.e. Icaro ‚· see note on 3, 25 and cf. Mart. 1v, 49, 5 aut
puero liquidas aptantem Daedalon alas. On the amative, see 593.

55. leno: the husband3 cf. Ovid, Am. 11, 19, 57 quid (mihi) eum lenone
marito 9² For some reason, possibly not in the mind of Juvenal him-

sels, the wife is not entitled to inherit 3 the husband is therefore written
down as heir in the gallant's will with the understanding that the legacy
shall go to the wife. The incident of Hor. 0. 111, 6, 25 f. is similar.
Juvenal probably had in mind the story told by Lucilius of a certain
Cipius who was called Pararencho (i.e. ‘ snoring in company ³) quod
simularet dormientem, quo impunitiue uxor eius moecharetur (Festus, p.
180, Thew.); compare Cicero's reference to the same story in Fam.
vn, 24, 1, and see note on 5, 4.⁸

¹ A Diomedea in twelve books was written about 15 nc. by Iullus Antonius 3 see Pa.-
Acron on Hor. 0. tv, 2, 33, and F. Buecheler, Rhein. Mus„ xmv, 1889, p. 818.

¹ Ulpian, Diffi, nvm, 5, 30, 8 qui quaestum επ adulterio uoeomsuaesecerit, plectitur .-
nee enim mediocriter deliquit, Qui lenocinium in umore excercuit.

⁸ This orthodox interpretation, based on the schol iast, is not entirely free from difficulty.
When Friedl. assumes that the wite, by the provisions of the Lex Iulia and the Leoe Papia
Poppaea, is prevented from inheriting because she is childless, he is driven to the further
assumption that the husband has a child by a former marriage. Possibly, however,
capere, instead of having its common technical meaning, ‘ inheriw may be taken as in 5,
18, in the sense of its compound (ς 44); cf. Sen. Ben. 11, 29, 6 maana accepimus, maiora
non cepimus. If so, we see a scheme like the modern ⁴ badger game‚' in which the guilty
pair are in collusion to fleece the gallant, who makes violent love to the wire, not suppos-
ing that she knows or the bribe received by her husband. For a criticism ot the current
view, see Gercke, l. 1. pp. 974 1.
