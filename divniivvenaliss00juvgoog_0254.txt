THE PARASITE

The treatment of parasites and poor clients at the tables os rich ἱ
patrons is a common subject iu Roman literature. Plautus, Terence,
and Martial furnish good illustrationS, and Pliny, Ep. 11, 6, gives an ἱ
account of a dinner in most respects similar to the one here described.

side, Lucian (De Mero. Oo‘nd.) furnishes the best parallels; and in Eng- l

and Virro (Sat. V, 2).

The satire as a whole is vigorous and leaves a distinct impression, but
Juvenal’s usual faults are apparent. Instead of following the regular
