The eighth satire, though marked by fine passages, cannot be called
one ot Juvenal’s best efforts. The thesis that noble birth is worthleae‚ ·
unless adorned by noble character, is worked out from various points os
view with a wealth of illustration and exeess os rhetorical eommonplaee.

In a series ot examples, drawn chiefly from Roman history, the writer
sets the vices and crimae of aristocrats over against the virtues and
great achievements of plebeianS. This picture, of course, like many of

J uvenal’s pictures, is one-sided ; the satirist selected material to suit his
purpose. Both parallel and contrast are furnished by the fourth satire θ
ot Persius, which is worked out from the Stoic point of view.

Here again J uvenal’s characteristic lack of sense for proportion is
evident (ἓ 36). From an exhortation to a provincial governor to show his
real nobility by a just and honest administration, the author is led into a
long digression (ll. 94-126) on provincial misgovernment‚ which certainly
has no direct connection with the main thesis (ἓ 141). Α really good ap-
preciation ot the public services of cicere, Marius, and others concludes
the satire.

1. stemmata: ‘ pedigree5.’ The imayines, arranged against the walls
os the atrium, were connected by painted lines to show the family tree.

Names in -anus indicated adoption in republican times ; e. g. the son of
L. Aemilius Paulus, the conqueror of Persem, adopted by P. Cornelius
Scipio, was called P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus But this custom died
out under the empire. See §g 24, 50.
