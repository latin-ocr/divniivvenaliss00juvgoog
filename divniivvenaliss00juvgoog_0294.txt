SATIRE X

m vmrt 01· minu wlsius

The world's literature contains numerous discourses on this subject,
none ot which is so well known or has exerted so wide an influence
as that of J uvenal.¹ English literature especially offers many remi-
niscenceS‚ translationS, and imitations; the most famous is Dr. J ohn-
son’s ‘ Vanity ot Human Wishe8.’ ’

In common with others of the later satireS, the tenth has certain
marked features which distinguish it from Juvenal’s earlier work : it
shows little contact with the life of the times, but has rather the char-
acter of a rhetorical treatise or essay (see p. XV, note 2). The author
selects his illustrations from the common stock of the schools ot decla-
mation (note on 1, 16), and, as one might expect, brings out only those
features which serve his purpose. Yet, notwithstanding the excessively
florid style and, in some partS, tedicus rhetoric, the tenth satire, be·
cause os the vigor of its narrative, the brilliance of its description, the
exuberance of its illustration‚ and the real applicability os its teaching
to our own and every time, will continue to be a favorite with readers
of Juvenal.

The second satire ot Persius may be read with profit in connection.
