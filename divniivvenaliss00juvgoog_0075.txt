INTRonUc'rIoN lxix

The rarity of vI, v11, and VIII may be seen from the
fact that only about 900 of them occur in the 207,269 Latin
hexameters examined by Manitius.¹ Of these 900, Lucre·
tius has 165 (2 56 of his verses) 3 Horace, 160 (4 ᾧ) ; Juvenal,
139 (3 ss) ; Vergil, 48 (ᾖ, 56). This was a freedom of satire
which goes back to EnniuS. Indeed, many of Vergil's ex-
amples are undoubted imitations of Ennius, or else intended
to give a touch of the antique. This is especially true of VIII,
which through such a famous line as Vergil, Aen. vl, 846 z

Unus qui nobis cunctando restituis rem,

must have suggested Ennius and the old poets to many of
Juvenal's hearers. In some cases at least the antique and
solemn touch, used seriously or satirically according to the
author's mood at the time, seems to have been felt. Com-
pare 1, 108, 1593 2, 28, 132 ; 3, 90, 191, 2033 5, 20, 88, 1143
6, 32, 3093 7, 208; 8, 9, 62, 112; 10, 82, 119, 225, etc. In
others, and possibly in some which I have just mentioned,
the touch was not so much the antique and solemn (serious
or otherwise) as the plain, old-fashioned, and homely.
The tetrasyllabic cadence,

IX. Cum populum gregibus comitum premit hic spoliator,

waS‚ as we saw, a rule of the Catullian versus spondium-3.
Otherwise it is extremely rare, and chiefly confined to
satire and the early poete. Manitius gives Lucretius 153
cases ; Vergil 513 Horace 343 Juvenal 55. The word is
usually a proper name, except in Lucretius, who has none.
Juvenal imitates the freedom of Lucretius in this respect.
Also he frequently neglects the rule of a preceding mono-
syllable.

To end the linc in a word of five syllables is still more
uncommon:

X. Quandoquidem inter nos sanctissima divitiarum.
